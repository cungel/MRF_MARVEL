## Reference

This repository is a **copy** of the original [TensorFlow MRI](https://github.com/mrphys/tensorflow-mri) project.

The **only modification** made to the original code is in the **Non-Uniform Fast Fourier Transform (NUFFT)** implementation, which has been adapted to support **GPU acceleration**.

No other part of the original codebase was changed.
